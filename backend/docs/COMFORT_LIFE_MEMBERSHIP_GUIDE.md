## Business Logic

### Discount Calculation
1. Check if service price falls within membership tier's discount range
2. Apply tier-specific percentage discount:
   - Moon: 15%
   - Star: 20%
   - Sun: 25%
3. Return discounted price or original price if outside range

### Membership Rules
- Users can upgrade between any plans
- Downgrade from annual to monthly is not allowed while annual plan is active
- Plan changes require canceling current membership and subscribing to new plan

## API Endpoints

### Get Plans
```http
GET /api/memberships/plans
```

### Subscribe to Plan
```http
POST /api/memberships/subscribe
{
  "tier": "moon_1_month",
  "isRecurring": false
}
```

### Calculate Service Discount
```http
POST /api/memberships/calculate-discount
{
  "membershipTier": "star_12_months",
  "servicePrice": 25.00
}
```

## Database Schema

### Memberships Table
- `tier`: VARCHAR - e.g., 'moon_1_month', 'star_12_months'
- `status`: VARCHAR - 'active', 'cancelled', 'expired'
- `auto_renewal`: BOOLEAN
- `start_date`: TIMESTAMP
- `end_date`: TIMESTAMP

## Frontend Implementation

### Key Components
1. **Tier Selector**: Choose between Moon, Star, Sun
2. **Duration Selector**: Choose 1, 3, 6, or 12 months
3. **Payment Toggle**: One-time vs Recurring
4. **Plan Details**: Dynamic display of selected plan features

### User Experience
- Visual tier indicators with icons and colors
- Clear pricing with original prices struck through for discounted plans
- Discount range clearly displayed
- Active membership status indicators
- Upgrade/downgrade restrictions clearly communicated

## Stripe Integration

### Price IDs Required
Each plan needs 2 Stripe Price IDs:
- One for recurring payments
- One for one-time payments

Example environment variables:
```
STRIPE_MOON_1_MONTH_RECURRING=price_moon_1_month_recurring
STRIPE_MOON_1_MONTH_ONETIME=price_moon_1_month_onetime
```

## Migration Notes

### From Previous System
- Old 'supersaver_month' and 'supersaver_year' plans are replaced
- Users with existing memberships should be migrated to equivalent new plans
- Update all references in booking and payment systems

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Add new membership tier support
ALTER TABLE memberships ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tier_category VARCHAR(10);
ALTER TABLE memberships ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS duration_months INTEGER;

-- Update existing memberships
UPDATE memberships SET 
  tier_category = CASE 
    WHEN tier = 'supersaver_month' THEN 'moon'
    WHEN tier = 'supersaver_year' THEN 'moon'
    ELSE 'moon'
  END,
  duration_months = CASE 
    WHEN tier = 'supersaver_month' THEN 1
    WHEN tier = 'supersaver_year' THEN 12
    ELSE 1
  END;
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Plan selection and tier switching
2. Duration changes within same tier
3. Upgrade/downgrade restrictions
4. Discount calculation for various service prices
5. Payment processing for both one-time and recurring
6. Membership status changes and renewals

### Discount Testing
Test with service prices:
- $15 (below all ranges)
- $20 (Moon range)
- $25 (Moon/Star range)
- $35 (Star/Sun range)
- $50 (Sun range only)
